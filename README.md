# FizzBuzz in WebAssembly

Exploring WebAssembly from scratch from a backend-person-point-of-view. A story in three acts.

---

Welcome to my journey where I will explore some [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).
We will start from scratch.
My goal is to look at everything bottom-up, without much magic tooling or frameworks on our way.
In this article, I prefer to build everything as much from scratch as possible.

Non-goal: We will *not* implement our own WebAssembly interpreter or runtime, but use existing ones.

TODO: learn GitHub actions to deploy live demos to of Part 2 and Part 3 on GitHub pages.
